# Portfolio-Website
Check out my website at antonliu.com! Also take a look at my cool 404 page by going to antonliu.com/ + anything!

This is my first website made with HTML,CSS, and JS. I started it during summer of 2019 to learn about web development, and to display everything about me (especially the stuff that didn't make it to my resume).  It is being constantly updated and renewed to fit my new experiences, projects, and skills. 

If you want to check out the styling, go to the scss folder (the CSS is automatically compiled using sass) for more compact structure and commments!

I'm still ironing out the details, so please contact me (with your OS and browser) if you discover any bugs!
